# Responsive Personal Portfolio

## Description

My goal was to create a resonsive we application that renders well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. This is the beginning of my personal portfolio that includes an about me seciton, links to my project, and a contact me page. I plan to continue to add to it as I progress through the bootcamp. 

### Usage
This portfolio can be a way that potential employers can get to know me and sample my work to better understand my skillset and professional goals.
